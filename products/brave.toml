  "\"If you switch on Brave Rewards and switch on ads (in Rewards settings) you will receive notifications promoting ads, and BAT to reward you for viewing those ads. While the ads you see are based on interests inferred from your browsing, Brave Ads is private and anonymous. The data is stored on your device, and are inaccessible to us.\" \r\n\r\n \"No data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as an individual leaves the Brave browser on your device. In the cases where we collect high-level statistics relating to web activity data (e.g. what are the estimated amount of ads that can be served to different content categories that users encounter as they browse the web) we use proven privacy mechanisms like local differential privacy that guarantee that no information about individual users will ever be revealed to us. Read more about how we achieve this with [Privacy Preserving Product Analytics](https://brave.com/privacy-preserving-product-analytics-p3a/) and [Private Advertising Analytics](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Randomized-Response-for-Private-Advertising-Analytics).

  "\"Nightly, Dev, and Beta versions of the Brave Browser are experimental previews of new Brave Browser versions.
